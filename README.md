Project Description
A simple and intentionally rough project built to test Unreal Engine. It includes:
- Basic save/load systems
- Simple graphic configuration settings
- Enemy systems with movement based on behavior trees
- Material switching systems
- Other small features that are straightforward to implement in Unity but require adapting to Unreal’s workflow
Overall, the project is intentionally rough—both visually and internally “ugly”—yet it fully served its purpose: applying and testing the features I wanted to explore in Unreal.

Normally, I wouldn’t upload a project like this to GitHub—it’s simple, rough, and mostly experimental. But since I don’t have any other Unreal Engine work on the platform, I’d rather share this than have nothing at all.
